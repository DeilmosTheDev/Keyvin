If I gonna update this software I give you a little hint where I would start to work on :

~ Different languages ( actually german because I am german haahaa )
~ Different themes
~ A last passwords backup list like a .json file which saves it on your pc 
~ little sounds like for the copy


It is completly free to use and you dont need anything to ask me if you want to use or share or whatever you want to do with my software I would just have a little thanks if you like it !
